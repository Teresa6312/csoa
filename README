# For jsonForm app is created for dyname form template creation, dynamic workflow creation and dynamic form request submission.
# By default, when a form template is created, it was set to save the form request data to jsonForm.Case, jsonForm.CaseData
# In this case, when a form request is submitted, it will be saved to jsonForm.Case and jsonForm.CaseData. If it is set with a workflow, the workflow instance and task instance data will be saved to jsonForm.WorkflowInstance, jsonForm.TaskInstance 
# BUT this design will not has good performance when the form request is submitted frequently or querying the form request data frequently.
# The solution is to create a new app, and set the form template to save the form request data to the new app.
# [STEP #1] copy and paste the following models to the new app's models.py file. (keep the same class/model name)
# jsonForm.Case
# jsonForm.CaseData
# jsonForm.WorkflowInstance, jsonForm.TaskInstance
# [STEP #2] copy and paste the following signal to the new app's signals.py file.
# jsonForm.signals.case_saved
# @receiver(pre_save, sender=Case)
# def case_saved(sender, instance, **kwargs):
# [STEP #3] Create or edit the form template, and set the form template to save the form request data to the new app.
# Backend app label: [set to the new app label]
